Project Title
=

A simple, pure Python, Xkcd-style password generator. 

e.g: "correct horse battery staple"

When invoked, this package will generate a short list of unique words, perhaps to a specified number, and then return them on sys.std.out. The user can also specify to remove spaces so the output can be easily copy-pasted or piped. The word list is customizable (words.txt), and already curated for length.
